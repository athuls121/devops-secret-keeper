# Devops Secret Keeper

About the Project:

This project presents a robust Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline on the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for a Python application named “Secret Keeper.” The primary objective is to streamline the software development lifecycle, improve efficiency, and ensure the deployment of high-quality applications. The project leverages GCP’s DevOps services, Kubernetes orchestration, Terraform, and DataDog to automate, optimize, and monitor the software development lifecycle. The project aims to demonstrate how automation, scalability, and best practices can enhance software delivery, efficiency, and quality. The project’s primary initiative is the development of “Secret Keeper,” which securely stores data as secrets within Redis while generating access tokens. This innovative approach allows authorized individuals to retrieve data using these tokens, ensuring high-security measures throughout the process. The project incorporates Infrastructure as Code (IAC) principles, employing Terraform to efficiently manage and provision infrastructure resources within GCP. The project also integrates DataDog to monitor the application deployed within the Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) cluster. This report provides an in-depth overview of the project, detailing the tools, methodologies, and strategies employed in implementing a robust CI/CD pipeline on the Google Cloud Platform.
